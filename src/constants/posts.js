    text: 'Apparently the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron had a bigger effect on Tony Stark than we initially thought. In Robert Downey Jr.’s sixth full appearance as Iron Man, the consummate rebel is willing to let the government take over the big decisions about how to deploy the Avengers. Judging from the trailers, Tony also appears to feel betrayed by Cap’s course of action. A showdown between Cap and Iron Man is inevitable at this point, but there’s no guarantee that they will both walk away from this fight.',

    text: 'At the end of the second Captain America movie, Sebastian Stan’s Winter Soldier appeared to remember that he was once Bucky Barnes, Cap’s best friend. And as we’ve seen in Ant-Man, the Winter Soldier has been found. In fact, it may be Bucky’s presence on Cap’s team that leads to more intense bad feelings from Iron Man’s team.',
